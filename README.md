14(c) certificate holders in the Untied States

14(c) certificate holders are legally allowed to pay individuals below the federal minimum wage. Typically these are people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. I scraped the source site and created a Tableau dashboard to display the data. The data/dashboard is now being used to remove 14(c) certificate holders across Minnesota.
